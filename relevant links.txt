2D contains the file IllustrisTNG.ipynb, which is the code used to run the 2D diffusion model, visualise the outputs and evaluate them via power spectra.
3D contains the same folder as https://github.com/DJodhun/PVDQ5, which is used to run the 3D diffusion model, and PVD Data Manipulation.ipynb, which contains the code used to make the dataset, visualise the inputs/outputs and compute the power spectra. 

Below are the links to the datasets - email goyalrajat0412@gmail.com or davjodhun@gmail.com or cdavies.dev@gmail.com for assistance.
